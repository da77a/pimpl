In the domain of commercial large-scale software development the following design principles come to the fore:

* API-centered design, 
* implementation hiding, 
* minimization of compilation and component dependencies, 
* separation of concerns,
* consistent and recognizable implementation and deployment patterns, 
* multi-platform support.

The Pimpl idiom can help great deal achieving these goals. It is a simple yet robust programming technique to minimize coupling via 

* the separation of public interface and private implementation and then 
* implementation hiding.
